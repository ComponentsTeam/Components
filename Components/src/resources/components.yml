# Three dashes mark start of document.

# READ THIS or you will be [[FRUSTRATED]]:
#
#   - Any token starting with one or two exclamation marks (!) is for internal
#     purposes.  Copy it as necessary, never omit it, and do not change it.
#
#   - Comments begin with a hash mark (#), and MUST be preceded by a space,
#     unless they are the only thing on a line.
#
#   - TABS WILL BREAK THE DOCUMENT.  Only use spaces!
#
#  +- FOREIGN LANGUAGES AND SPECIAL CHARACTERS
#  |
#  `- If you're using special, non-ANSI characters (such as many northern-
#  |  European-specific letters/accents), you MUST save this file as Unicode.
#  |  Either UTF-8 or UTF-16 will do.
#  |
#  `- If you are asked about a BOM or byte order mark while saving as Unicode,#  |  yes, you want one, and I believe it should be little endian.  Most
#  |  editors should figure this out without prompting you, though.
#  |
#  `- If you are switching between ANSI and Unicode, you need to CONVERT, not
#     just save.  Otherwise, the first three(?) bytes in the file will be
#     corrupted.
#
#   - The document begins with three dashes (---) and ends with three periods
#     (...).  Generally, don't put anything outside this marked region unless
#     it is either already there, or you have a specific reason to do so.
#
#   - Pointers are marked like &this.  References are marked like *this.
#     Mark a node with a pointer to reference it later in the document.  This
#     allows you to "name" nodes, and reuse them without having to copy/paste.
#
#   - ANYTHING MARKED LIKE !this HAS A STRICTLY DEFINED STRUCTURE.  You cannot
#     add extra nodes.  You cannot omit nodes.  Variable-size nodes can, of
#     course, still be of any length.  In this case, the entire document is
#     strictly defined, as marked by !cdoc.
#
#   - Strings (text) should ALWAYS be enclosed in double quotes (")
#     preferably, or at least single quotes (').
